#flood-data release 1.5.0 - 13th June 2023

Update of npm dependancies and node version for lambda functions.

Note: serverless was upgraded from v2 to v3 which was a breaking change for deployment.
The breaking changes were almost all to do with AWS IAM permissions and in conjuction with WebOps
we iterated and resolved until deployment to dev succeded (see slack channel for details).
The assumtion is that the changes made for dev environment permissions will propogate through to the
higher environments.

#Beta (service refresh) flood-data release 1.1.0 - 28 October 2020

This is to deploy updated processing of negative river levels.

Note that data processing AWS lambda functions for beta have diverged from those
on live and a decision was taken to create a new repo for the beta app. This
repo is https://github.com/DEFRA/flood-data and was created from the alpha
branch of https://github.com/DEFRA/lfw-data. This will require some changes to
the beta deployment pipeline.

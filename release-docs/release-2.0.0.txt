#flood-data release 2.0.0 - 14th November 2023

Update of fwis-process, fgs-process, ffoi-process and station-process lambdas.
These lambdas previously used the node-sql npm package to construct large INSERT sql statements.
This package had a vulnerability and is no longer updated, this change removes this package from flood-data's dependencies.
